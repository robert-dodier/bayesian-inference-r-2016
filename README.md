# bayesian-inference-r-2016
Notes and code for presentation to PDX R meetup Sept 21, 2016 on Bayesian inference in R.

Update January 2017: I've formatted the presentation as a PDF which contains all the text and graphics.
You should be able to view this in your browser without going through the steps below.
See: [Introduction\_to\_Bayesian\_Inference\_in\_R.pdf](../blob/master/Introduction_to_Bayesian_Inference_in_R.pdf)

Previous notes:

The presentation is: bayesian-inference-r-2016.html

The presentation is composed with [remark.js](http://remarkjs.com);
after cloning this repo,
you can just point your browser to file:///path/to/bayesian-inference-r-2016.html,
but you'll need an Internet connection to use Remark,
as it wants to download fonts and MathJax.
